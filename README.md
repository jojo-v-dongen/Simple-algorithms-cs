# Simple Algorithms in C#

Welcome to my "Simple Algorithms in C#" repository!

This repository is a part of my journey in learning C# and basic algorithms. Here, you will find straightforward implementations of various sorting and searching algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

- **Insertion Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Bogo Sort**
- **Pigeonhole Sort**

## Searching Algorithms

- **Binary Search**
- **Linear Search**

### How to Use

After cloning the git repository, you can run the `main.cs` file, which will allow you to select and try different algorithms. Alternatively, you can run the code for individual algorithms as needed.
